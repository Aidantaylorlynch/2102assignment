            <p>The aim of this game is to get your score as high as possible.</p>

            <p>You can shoot as many lasers as you want. </p>
            <p>Controls: Up arrow - Thrust, Left/Right - Steer, Spacebar - Shoot</p>
            <p>features:</p>
            <p>- score: as you shoot asteroids your score will increase</p>
            <p>- svg: game objects are made with svg</p>
            <p>- input: input is taken from the keyboard</p>
            <p>- wrap: objects that fly off the screen (except lasers) will appear on the other side of the screen (torus topology)</p>
            <p>- collisions: collisions between the palyer and asteroid will end the game. Collisions between lasers and asteroids will earn score and destroy asteroids</p>
            <p>- thrust: the players ship will reach a maximum speed the longer you hold down the forward arrow. It will slow down overtime if you let go.</p>
